# MVC Lecture
Model, View, Controller lecture in a CRUD app. Users learn about MVC by interating with the app. Users can add on my lecture by commenting. they can also delete their comments.

## Lessons Learned:

I remember feeling great when I got the comment feature to work and seeing other users comments. Some users deleted other users comments but that was because this lecture was no auth. What I learned most of all was the MVC. By creating this CRUD app I now know that the Model handles the objects, the Controller is where the logic happens, and the View is what is displayed on the screen. To this day I use the MVC architecture on my projects. (If I were to make a new one I would add local-passport auth so that people cant delete others comments haha.)
